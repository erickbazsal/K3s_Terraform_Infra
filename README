The purpose of this repo is to practice lessons from Udemy course "More than certified in Terraform" taught by Derek Morgan.

The code in this repo will build a basic k3s infrastructure(VPC, Subnets, Internet GW, RDS Instance, EC2 Instance, Load Balancer, Key, etc)

In order to have this repo functioning values in terraform.tfvars have to be specified as well as providing public ssh key(public_key_path = "./id_rsa.pub").
It also contains Personal Notes made during the course which help me understand about functions and other important information shared by the instructor.
